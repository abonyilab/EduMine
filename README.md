Graph Configuration Model based Evaluation of the Education-Occupation Match

Laszlo Gadar and Janos Abonyi


We developed a graph-based model of education to work transition. To extract the
hidden structure of the career paths we analyzed the degree distributions of the
bipartite graphs of educational programs and professions, and we modified the Newman
modularity measure to evaluate their matching. The proposed network model is based
on the integration of the databases of the National Tax Administration, the National
Health Insurance Fund, and the data warehouse of the Hungarian higher education. To
demonstrate the information content of this administrative database, we presented a
brief analysis of gender pay gap and the spatial distribution of over-education. The
calculated matching measures and clusters can support policymakers to fine-tune the
fragmented program structure of the Hungarian higher education.
